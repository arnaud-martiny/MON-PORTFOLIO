    "paragraph1": "For me, a website is much more than a showcase. It's the digital meeting point between an idea and its audience. My passion is to build this connection: to design web experiences that are not only beautiful but also logical, efficient, and intuitive.",
    "paragraph2": "My Full-Stack approach allows me to manage this vision from A to Z. On the <strong>Back-End</strong>, I architect robust server logic and databases (PHP, MySQL) that form the application's backbone. On the <strong>Front-End</strong>, I sculpt every interaction to create a fluid and engaging user experience (UX/UI), where technology becomes invisible.",
    "paragraph3": "This dual expertise is my greatest strength: it ensures total consistency between technology and design. Eager for challenges and meticulous, I approach every project—whether creating a custom platform or optimizing a Shopify store—with the same commitment: to deliver a reliable, effective digital product that you will be proud of.",
